        <h2>CloneDodge!</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
                The art. The gameplay is somewhat unique in that it isn't a clone of any particular genre
            </li>

            <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
                What is interesting about your game technology?

            <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
                What did you learn from this prototype?
                What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
                Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
                <ul>
                    <li>Character Spritesheets: <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1">Phaser Tutorial</a></li>

            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
                W
            </li>

            <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
                A simple race against time while you try to dodge your clone! Your dexterity will be tested.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
                State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
                State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
                Input - Keyboard
                Randomness - Deterministic
                Play Style - Competitor
                Genres - Platformer
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
                I am primarily evaluating a time based speed icnrease for the enemy that should help in making the difficulty curve more fun.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
                I want them to have fun and feel a little anxious as the speed of the enemy goes up.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
                A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
                Having a fast reaction time and realizing that you can jump better in corners will help hit higher scores.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
                A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
                How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
            </li>

            <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
                Everyone. My games strive to be accessible and fun for anyone to pick up quickly and enjoy.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
                Less than 60 secs on average unless you are REALLY good.
            </li>
