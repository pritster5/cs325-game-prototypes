        <h2>CloneDodge!</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
                The art. The gameplay is somewhat unique in that it isn't a clone of any particular genre
            </li>

            <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
                A cool feature of this game is that the enemy speeds up over time making the gameplay significantly more challenging.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
                What did you learn from this prototype?
                A lot. It took me a while to get a grasp on the general structure of the game engine
                and thinking in terms of pure JS helped me understand the true felixbility of it.

                What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
                Easiest Part: Adding physics between the sprites. 
                Hardest Part: Surprisingly enough, the hardest part was the timer. 
                The documentation for phaser3 is some of the worst I have ever used.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
                Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

                    <li>Art: My Own</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
                Mario. Although the core game mechanic is different.
            </li>

            <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
                A simple race against time while you try to dodge your clone! Your dexterity will be tested.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
                N/A
            </li>

            <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
                State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
                Input - Keyboard
                Randomness - Deterministic
                Play Style - Competitor
                Genres - Platformer
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
                I am primarily evaluating a time based speed icnrease for the enemy that should help in making the difficulty curve more fun.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
                I want them to have fun and feel a little anxious as the speed of the enemy goes up.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
                A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
                Having a fast reaction time and realizing that you can jump better in corners will help hit higher scores.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
                There's not much of a story but the basic premis is that you have a very angry onion man chasing you. 
                He's angry at you because you can jump but he can't. So he has made up his mind to catch you instead :D
            </li>

            <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
                Everyone. My games strive to be accessible and fun for anyone to pick up quickly and enjoy.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
                Less than 60 secs on average unless you are REALLY good.
            </li>
